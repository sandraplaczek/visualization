== geometric_tools

The geometric tools are classes for the geometric elements "point", "line", "box" and "area". 

geometric_tools.rb
- loads all classes

point.rb
- geometrical point
- usage in the geometric tools: start- and endpoint of a line
- usage in the visualization of metabolic networks: 
    - center of a transformation
    - compound


line.rb
- geometrical line
- usage in the geometric tools: three or more lines form a box
- usage in the visualization of metabolic networks: 
    - connects one compound to the center of a transformation
    - two or mor lines are part of a transformation


box.rb
- geometrical box
- usage in the geometric tools: a box is made of several lines and has an area
- usage in the visualization of metabolic networks: 
    - combines several transformations to a pathway
    - includes several lines (transformations) and points (compounds)


area.rb
- geometrical area
- usage in the geometric tools: an area is created with a box which defines the boundaries of the area
- usage in the visualization of metabolic networks:
    - via the area compounds and transformations can be assigned to the according pathways
